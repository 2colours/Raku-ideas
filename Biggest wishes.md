Modules:
- convenience
	- mi6 as a reference of Raku
	- Getopt::Long is more than welcome - standardization?
- "killer features":
	- Cro as a reference of Raku
	- Red as a reference of Raku
	- we have some momentum with ML
	- Leon's idea is worth considering: GIR
- the old ecosystem (and modules site) used to be a social place - let's try to keep the good parts
	- https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/blob/main/ADOPT-ME.md
	- let's try to reach out to authors

LSP!
- RakuNavigator by bscan: let's help him!

Content and communication:
- books
	- https://perl6book.com/
		- content should be abstracted
		- different domain name?
	- even if there are no new books, this should be a top-level management category for the best possible representation
- revive Richard's Citation Index:
	- Ecosystem module by Liz++
		- release-date already present in the meta folder in REA - let's retrieve it?
	- can we go back in time? retrospectively filling the graph
- raku.org
	- new site by CIAvash?
	- old site?
		- Bootstrap update
		- gradually moving from Perl can still be desirable
		- content could be taken from CIAvash
	- universal content considerations
		- better description of IRC
		- better description of ecosystem-related stuff
			- making it clear what is official-ish (core approved)
				- zef
				- raku.land
				- Cro, mi6... whatever we are proud of
			- versioning
				- advertise continuous development
				- compatibility guarantees
				- documentation guarantees?
- docs.raku.org
	- new site by Altai-man?
	- known issues of keeping content up-to-date
- the Weeklies are good - make them louder
- "fan-made", unofficial content needs to be appreciated
	- part of the story: Raku CCR project - good idea, let's take it seriously
- tutorials
	- "first language Raku" series? [[First language Raku tutorial]]
	- some really-really good materials about containers in Raku would be essential

Language and implementation:
- 6.e is being discussed by RSC
- up-to-date JVM and JS backend would be welcome
- standalone executable would be welcome
- better Windows support (hate to say it...)
