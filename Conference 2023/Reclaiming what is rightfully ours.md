## Renovation in Raku land

### Ruminations
- does Raku have
	- books, other learning materials?
	- state of art documentation
	- profilers, debuggers?
	- highlighters, LSP?
	- a library for certain task (from parsers to native bindings and wrapping public API's)
	- workflows to address certain known challenges?
- common sentiments
	- "Raku is a young language*"
		- for how long? ðŸ¤”
	- "It would be nice, if only somebody did it"
- first offshoot: not enough contributors (?)
	- Raku's design is mostly stable
	- retention is not enough, need to attract new people
	- getting people involved needs work
		- visibility + the offer itself
	- lowering the barrier of contribution
		- knowledge sharing
		- "architect": manager or hacker?
- realisation: there is way more content than we make use of!
	- "Raku is a young language *with a long history*"
	- Raku does have something for pretty much  everything I listed up there
	- there have even been unbitrot events...
	- inspiring example in the present: the doc team
		- unbreaking the site
		- introducing new site design
		- adding new content
		- plans going forward
- challenges and reactions
	- needs to be maintainable
		- for a long time
		- with little resources
	- choosing stable technology
		- support (for the future as well)
	- knowledge sharing
		- one advantage of dogfooding
			- others:
				- getting more involved in creating and maintaining tools
				- getting a "client" for another technology
	- making use of automations (Travis, now Github Actions)
- what I've been doing
	- laid out some plans for
		- modern squashathons
		- a possible new workgroup (ET)
	- HTML::Tag, HTML::Template, File::Temp
	- raku.org project
		- mowyw turned very obscure
		- similar system: Template6
			- a project in itself
			- could still do better with knowledge sharing...
		- I have a working prototype, needs more testing
			- need to up my container knowledge
	- modules.raku.org project
		- I like it in theory
			- community-owned
				- Raku.land: passing ownership? Outsourcing an important service?
			- community-oriented structure
		- written in Perl 5 (Mojolicious)
		- too far out of reach so far
		- approached a couple of people with the idea
	- Atom highlighter project
		- important bit: Textmate highlighter grammar
			- which I don't know ðŸ˜…
		- Github linguist uses it
			- PCRE vs Oniguruma, fun times...
		- decaffeination
		- ad-hoc AWK-driven templating of CSON files
		- now all in (somewhat) documented Raku Hashes
		- output is JSON
		- do we care about Atom itself? ðŸ¤”
		- got me involved with Pulsar and ppm in particular
			- interesting story on its own
			- maintenance of Atom is a huge disappointment
				- code more rotten than most of anything with Raku
				- no consistency
				- somewhat ad-hoc "spectests"
			- great experience with the Pulsar devs
			- learned a lot
	- Half-hearted, pending attempts
		- Ddt
			- didn't get along with the previous maintainer
			- feels like it should be mostly redone...
		- SpitSH
			- great idea
			- overwhelming for me
	- ecosystem housekeeping (mostly raku-community-modules)
		- minor things
			- improving CI and tests
			- looking for simple issues
			- reviewing and merging PR's
			- detaching repos that were originally forks
			- updating to best practices (`use v...`, Raku extensions)
			- leveraging migration to the "zef ecosystem"
		- could keep one person busy
		- modules I can recall
			- [Data-MessagePack](https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Data-MessagePack)
			- [Benchmark](https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Benchmark)
			- [File-Find](https://github.com/raku-community-modules/File-Find)

- moral of the story
	- there is always something you can do
	- no need to be particularly competent at _anything_
	- a little bit of attention can make a huge difference
- "requests for comments"
	- for modern squashathons https://github.com/2colours/Raku-ideas/blob/main/Squashathon%20reborn.md
	- for an Editor & Tooling workgroup https://github.com/2colours/Raku-ideas/blob/main/Raku%20Editor%20and%20Tooling%20workgroup.md
	- for the raku.org tooling https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/184
