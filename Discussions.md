1. **(OPENED)** problem-solving, what is "Discussions for" - proposal
	- to ease the "historical" tension of opening issues
	- when there is no well-understood and highly consensual "issue"
	- when the analysis of a certain topic is more important than to get a solution
2. **(OPENED)** methods `list` vs `List`:
	- the latter clearly coerces to `List`
	- what does the former do?
	- how does it relate to `cache`?
3. What is the `Instance.Class::method` syntax
	- it looks like lookup but it only seems to work for calls
	- `Instance.Class::` itself is invalid
