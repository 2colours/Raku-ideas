- who are the infrastructure team and how can one address them?
- is there a way to join the infrastructure team? if so, how?
- what are the tasks and/or responsibilites of members?
- is the infrastructure team backed up by TRF?
- is there a rough estimation of resources that
	- the community can spend "officially"
	- infrastructure-controlled things take up at the moment
- what domains are owned/handled by the community?
- what is the workflow for changing and deploying raku.org and related sites?
	- the to-be doc site
	- modules.raku.org
- where can the following types of issues be addressed?
	- domain choices
	- content/code of websites
	- new services
	  again, example: how do "we" relate to raku.land at the moment? are there any plans, and if there were, how could that be handled?
- how does it relate to communication channels? Does the team have special relevance for Raku's
	- Twitter
	- Reddit
	- IRC channels
	- Discord
	- (whatever I'm forgetting, you get the idea)
	  Example: if there is technical involvement for communication channels (e.g a bot for one of the listed platforms), does the infrastructure team have anything to do with that?
