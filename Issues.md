1. library enum used in MAIN, import from bin/ script - enum doesn't get parsed
2. built-in names cannot be used as enums in MAIN, otherwise the parsing fails silently
3. %?RESOURCES<>.IO compile-time - why couldn't it be slurped?
4. Slips
	1. X and Z disregards them
	2. they unwrap even if they are in Scalar containers - is this desirable?
5. .& detachment
	1. why is it not detachable in the first place?
	2. why does `'asd'  .comb.&dd` count as detached? Surely it couldn't be more attached to the `.comb` part?
6. `zef --help` writes to stderr
7. smartmatch to S/// _is_ useful and it _does_ work
	- exactly as `$foo ~~ /regex/` or `$foo ~~ m/regex/` would work
		- sets the $/ match variable
		- returns with the result of substitution
	- `given` or `with` is not sufficient replacement because there can be only one of them per statement
	- `$foo ~~ S/a/b/ ~~ S/c/d/` is actually a good-looking paradigm
	- alas, the current behavior is documented: https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Substitution -> I propose the adoption as well
		- either deleting the note plain and simple
		- or also adding that it works like `$foo ~~ /regex/`, setting $/
8. `sub demo(|c, :$name) { say c; say $name; }; demo(1);`
	- "expected 1 positional but got 1" WTF?
	- seems like it actually expects no positionals at all
	- how does this work?
9. `().min == Inf && ().max == -Inf` ?
