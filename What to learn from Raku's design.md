## The good parts
- approach to textual content
	- strings are NOT arrays of a predefined thing
	- string length is an ambiguous concept
	- character is outright a meaningless concept - no character type please, EVER
- "last statement gives return value" is a decent idea
	- in a semicolon language, I'd rather use the semicolon as a statement separator, therefore last semicolon would discard the value
- `.=` syntax
- `.&`
	- maybe push towards UFCS?
- regex
	- new syntax and semantics should probably still remain in a "blessed" (semi-official) package
- dedicated coercive operators and basically an open list of operators overall
- topic variable
  I wouldn't die for this feature but I think it can be done right and Raku mostly got it right
- state variables
- standard library
	- snitch (also in Ruby, called tap)
	- powerful, stateful mapping
	- rich numeric system
		- maybe wouldn't try to keep it in the standard library itself, more like "blessed" packages
	- opt-out bigints
- the concept of hypering
- kebab-case
	- I'd like to preserve this, with or without sigils
	- wouldn't absolutely die for it though, if the tradeoff is too risky
- multi-dispatch
	- would like to save the concept, the execution was bad though
- `unless` and similar redundant structures
	- more good than bad but wouldn't die for them
- heredoc and various quotations
	- most types, if not all
	- I heard some of this can be tough: wouldn't die for them if it's getting out of hand
## The bad parts
- inconsistency
  This is not an explicit decision, more like deliberate ignorance about a virtue
- dependency management
	- the module vs distribution dichotomy is useless
		- there is no point in bundling independent units of code at an ecosystem level
		- there is also no point to pretend that interdependent units can be directly depended on
	- metadata has to belong to the actual dependencies anyway
		- metadata belonged to the distributions while dependencies where the modules - no-go
- code sharing and import/export
	- imports go to local scope with low control over what you need - no-go
	- implicit definition of namespaces - no-go
	- how to even resolve namespaces is worth considering (not too happy about the Python or Java way either)
	- not much point to have both namespaces and separate exports, integrate them some way
- monkey-patchable grammar
	- makes the language virtually unparseable
	- something akin to Ruby or Groovy is still better
- feed operators, the way they worked
	- bad precedence
	- required subroutines only, as opposed to methods
	- completely different semantics for arrays
- allomorphs
	- completely dead idea, a sabotage of LSP, basically the glorification of the diamond problem
- rational denominators overflowing by default
- management/meta-design problems
	- versioning vs (essentially unversioned) Rakudo
	- lack of proper, evaluable specification
	- lack of grammar description in a comprehensible way
		- you can't describe it? then maybe think about making it simpler anyway
- overly packed grammar features
	- like `[&&]` being ambiguous for reduction and an array of an anonymous function
	- call syntaxes and whitespaces
- much of OO
	- implicitly swallowing named arguments in methods
	- total lack of compatibility between subroutines and methods
	- unability to even get a pointer to a method without reflection
	- this whole syntax hack with the sigils replacing `self`
- type objects as missing values
- Nil
	- at least the way it works
		- Failures are considered funny versions of Nil
		- but Nil also resets variables to their default value, as pretty much the only way to achieve that
		- it has totally random, weird coercion rules
	- is it needed/useful anyway?
## Mixed feelings
- junctions
	- is it worth having? maybe hypering makes it unnecessary?
	- how does it affect code readability?
 	- leaning towards *negative* now: obfuscated and confusing code when multiple quantors are involved
- smartmatching
	- the theory *might* work but only with some properly defined expected semantics
- sigils
	- not dogmatically against them but I feel they failed to add any value
- Failures (as opposed to Errors)
	- need to think more about it
- autovivification
	- sometimes it's convenient but is it worth it as a hard default?
	- maybe a separate "script mode" and "program mode" would be good
 - some other OO parts
 	- visibility applied to instances rather than classes is peculiar but worth experimenting with
